# ============================================================
# Step 2+3 of the deploy flow:
#   (1) build binary locally  →  (2) sync to server  →  (3) mount into container
#
# Unlike deploy/old/scripts/sync-to-server-artifact.sh, there is NO
# `docker compose build` step here at all — every image except one
# (gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12, nginx:1.27-alpine, postgres:16-alpine,
# hashicorp/vault, nats, migrate/migrate) is public and unmodified; the
# server only needs `docker compose pull` (cached after the first run) and
# the rsynced binaries/static assets bind-mounted in. This is what makes
# redeploys fast: no server-side compile, no server-side image build. The
# one exception is git-gateway-service's own small runtime image (needs a
# real `git` binary — see docker-compose.yml's comment on that service) —
# built locally by build-local.sh, never on a registry, so it's transferred
# via `docker save | ssh docker load` (step 3 below) instead of a pull.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy/dev/scripts/sync-to-server.sh <version>
# Example:
#   ./deploy/dev/scripts/sync-to-server.sh 0.1.0
