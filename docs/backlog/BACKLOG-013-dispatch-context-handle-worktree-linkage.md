# BACKLOG-013: `agentSession.listActive`'s dispatch contexts can't be keyed onto `remoteAgentSessions` (worktreeId vs. assigneeHandle) — RESOLVED (backend half)

**Origin:** `specs/frontend/crs/v3/storage/tasks/FE-TASK-STORAGE-012-hydrate-dev-servers-and-agent-sessions.md` (remote-agent-sessions.ts half)
**Priority:** Low — blocked on the same unimplemented coordinator/dispatch stack as BACKLOG-009/017, not on frontend engineering time (see "Update session 3" below)
**Status:** Backend RESOLVED 2026-09-08 — user picked option 1 ("add a `worktree_id` field to `dispatch_contexts`"). Frontend mapping intentionally NOT implemented — would wire dead UI to a data source with zero real producers today.

---

> **Update 2026-09-08:** Implemented option 1 exactly as sketched below,
> mirroring BACKLOG-006's `user_id` precedent:
>
> - `migrations/0003_dispatch_context_worktree_id`: adds
>   `dispatch_contexts.worktree_id TEXT NULL` + a partial index
>   (`WHERE worktree_id IS NOT NULL`), same shape as `user_id`'s.
> - `orchestration.proto`: `worktree_id` added to both `DispatchContext`
>   (round-trips on every read) and `CreateDispatchContextRequest` (new
>   optional input field, field 4) — **caller-supplied**, unlike `user_id`
>   (from identity): the server has no way to derive "which worktree" on
>   its own, same treatment as `handle`/`coordinator_run_id`/
>   `orchestration_task_id`.
> - `domain.DispatchContext.WorktreeID` + `NewDispatchContext` signature
>   updated; `usecase.CreateDispatchContextInput.WorktreeID` threaded
>   through to `DispatchContextRepository.CreateDispatchContext` (now takes
>   a `worktreeID` param) and persisted.
> - Read paths updated to round-trip it: `ListActiveDispatchContextsForUser`,
>   `GetLatestForTask`, `toProtoDispatchContext`.
> - `api-gateway`'s real REST caller (`POST /v1/orchestration/dispatch-contexts`,
>   `orchestration_routes.go`) now accepts `worktree_id` in the request body
>   and threads it through — this is the actual, already-existing caller
>   path CreateDispatchContext's other fields (handle/coordinator_run_id)
>   already flow through, not a new integration point.
> - New test: `TestCreateDispatchContext_ThreadsWorktreeID`. `go build`/
>   `go vet`/`go test` clean for both `orchestration-service` and
>   `api-gateway`.
>
> **What's NOT done — the actual remaining work**: the frontend side
> (`FE-TASK-STORAGE-012`'s `mapDispatchContextsToSessions`, reading
> `agentSession.listActive`'s results and populating
> `remoteAgentSessions: Record<worktreeId, RemoteAgentSession>`) was not
> touched this session — this file's scope was backend-go only. Whoever
> creates a dispatch context (still not traced in this session — likely
> wherever `POST /v1/orchestration/dispatch-contexts` is actually called
> from) also needs to start passing `worktree_id` for existing dispatches
> to start showing up keyed correctly; new ones will round-trip
> automatically once that caller is updated.
>
> **Update 2026-09-08 (session 3): traced "whoever calls it" — nobody does.**
> `grep -rn "dispatch-contexts"` across the entire repo (frontend/, desktop/,
> agent/, mobile/, backend-go/) finds exactly one hit outside
> `orchestration_routes.go` itself: nothing. `POST /v1/orchestration/dispatch-contexts`
> has **zero real callers anywhere in this codebase** — not from frontend,
> not from desktop, not from agent/. This is the **same root cause
> BACKLOG-009/017 already documented**: the autonomous coordinator/dispatch
> stack (`TASK-TASKV1-005-01..09` — `CoordinatorRun` domain/repo/usecases,
> `WorkerDispatcher`, the tick loop that would actually call
> `CreateDispatchContext`) is fully speced but never implemented. Concretely:
> `agentSession.listActive` (wscompat, already wired) calls
> `ListActiveDispatchContextsForUser`, which will always return an empty
> list in production today, because nothing ever creates a row for it to
> return.
>
> Implementing `mapDispatchContextsToSessions` right now would map a
> permanently-empty data source — dead UI wiring, not a "small, unblocked"
> task as this file's own priority line still claims. **Downgrading this
> item**: it is blocked on the exact same thing BACKLOG-009/017 are (the
> coordinator/dispatch stack's implementation pass), not on frontend
> engineering time. Revisit once that stack ships and something actually
> calls `CreateDispatchContext` with a real `worktree_id`.

## What this is

`FE-TASK-STORAGE-012` wants `remote-agent-sessions.ts`'s
`remoteAgentSessions: Record<worktreeId, RemoteAgentSession>` slice hydrated
from `agentSession.listActive` (real, working RPC as of 2026-09-08 — see
`BACKLOG-006`, resolved). Wiring this turned out to need a mapping that
doesn't exist.

## Why it's blocked

`orchestration-service`'s `DispatchContext.assigneeHandle` (`handle` on the
wire) is documented, in the domain code's own comment, as a
`KeyedAsyncQueue` **serialization key for a terminal-hosted AI-agent
worker** — an opaque string chosen for mutual-exclusion purposes, not a
`worktreeId`. `orchestrationTaskId` is the other candidate field, but it's
a logical FK into `orchestration_tasks` (a DAG-node id space,
`orchestration-service`'s own), not task-service's `Task.id` and
definitely not a frontend `worktreeId`.

No table, proto message, or usecase anywhere in `orchestration-service`
carries a `worktreeId` today. `grep -rn "worktree" backend-go/services/orchestration-service/`
returns nothing outside comments.

## What NOT to do

Don't assume `assigneeHandle` happens to equal a `worktreeId` in practice
(e.g. because some caller today constructs it that way) and hard-code that
assumption into the frontend mapping — the domain's own doc comment
explicitly says this field means something else, and a future change to
how handles are generated would silently break the mapping with no type
error to catch it.

## The decision needed

Someone who owns the terminal-pane ↔ dispatch-context relationship needs
to pick one:

1. **Add a `worktree_id` field to `dispatch_contexts`**, populated by
   whoever calls `CreateDispatchContext` (mirrors this session's own
   `user_id` addition — same pattern, same precedent) — if the real
   caller genuinely knows the worktree at creation time.
2. **Resolve `assigneeHandle` to a worktreeId via whatever registry already
   maps terminal handles to worktrees** (if one exists in `agent/` or
   `desktop/`'s terminal-pane management) — needs confirming such a
   registry exists and is reachable from the frontend without a new
   cross-repo call.
3. **Redesign the frontend hydrate target** — instead of forcing dispatch
   contexts into the existing `worktreeId`-keyed slice, surface
   `agentSession.listActive`'s results in a new, independently-keyed UI
   section (e.g., "Active Agent Dispatches," keyed by dispatch context id)
   that doesn't need a worktree association at all.

## Once decided

- If (1): mirror `TASK-BE-STORAGE-007`'s exact migration/repository/proto
  pattern for the new column.
- If (2) or (3): implement `mapDispatchContextsToSessions`
  (`FE-TASK-STORAGE-012`'s original scope) against whichever resolution
  path is chosen.
