// Package eventbus wires notification-service's HandleIncomingEvent
// usecase to NATS JetStream via common/eventbus.Consumer — this is the
// "primary consumer of the async bus" role from notification-service.md
// §1/§3/§6, unusually central compared to a typical service's thin outbox
// publisher: N long-lived JetStream consumers, one per subscribed subject.
//
// Fan-out fix (docs/execution-plan.md Epic F): every subscription below
// uses commoneventbus.Consumer.SubscribeEphemeral, not Subscribe. Subscribe
// would give every notification-service replica the SAME durable consumer
// name, which JetStream treats as one shared cursor — only ONE replica
// would ever receive a given domain event, so only that replica's
// broadcaster.Broadcast call would fire, and only ITS locally-connected
// StreamNotifications subscribers would see it (see
// internal/adapter/broadcaster's doc comment for the full symptom).
// SubscribeEphemeral gives each replica its own private cursor, so every
// replica independently translates and broadcasts every event to its own
// local subscribers — cluster-wide fan-out, no new subject or republish hop
// needed.
