// StubComplexExecutor implements usecase.ComplexExecutor as a stub that
// returns a synthesized execution reference without calling
// orchestration-service. Real wiring needs: an
// orchestrationv1.OrchestrationServiceClient (gRPC) dialed to
// orchestration-service, handing off to its coordinator (task-service.md
// §3.1), which sequences subtask/dependency execution and itself reaches
// the Dev Server Agent for worker dispatch. orchestration-service calls
// back into task-service to read/update task state as it progresses — that
// inbound path is this service's gRPC server (internal/adapter/grpc), not
// this client.
